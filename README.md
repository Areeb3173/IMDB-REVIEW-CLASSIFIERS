# IMDB-REVIEW-CLASSIFIERS
It is a IMDB REVIEW CLASSIFIERS in which we have 50k reviews of movie so we classify with the help of NLP.


### Objectives

#### 1. Build a Classifier for Sentiment Analysis
- **Goal**: Categorize reviews as positive or negative.

#### 2. Topic Modeling
- **Goal**: Identify common topics or themes discussed in reviews.
  
### Details

#### 1. Classifier for Sentiment Analysis
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization
  - Stop-word removal
  - Text normalization (e.g., lowercasing, stemming, lemmatization)
- **Algorithms to Experiment**:
  - Traditional ML: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
  - Deep Learning: RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs
  - Pre-trained Models: BERT for improved accuracy
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score

#### 2. Topic Modeling
- **Approaches**:
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
  - Embedding-based methods like BERTopic
- **Insights**:
  - Identify clusters of topics (e.g., acting, screenplay, music)
  - Compare discovered topics with movie genres or tags
- **Evaluation**:
  - Interpret and visualize topics
  - Assess alignment with known genres/tags

### Deliverables
- **Report or Notebook**:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualizations of demographic and textual data
  - **Model Results**:
    - Preprocessed data and model training insights
    - Performance comparison across models
  - **Visualizations**:
    - Best and worst-reviewed movies by genre
